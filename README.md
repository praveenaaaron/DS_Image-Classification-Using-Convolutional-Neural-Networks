## Overview
This project involves building and evaluating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from a publicly available dataset. The objective is to achieve high accuracy while understanding CNN architecture and its applications.

## Skills Gained
- Deep Learning Fundamentals
- Deployment of Machine Learning Models

## Domain
Deep Learning

## Problem Statement
Build and evaluate a CNN to classify images from a publicly available dataset. The aim is to achieve high accuracy while understanding CNN architecture and its applications.

## Business Use Cases
- Image Processing
- Workflow Automation

## Approach
### 1. Dataset Loading and Exploration
- Import the dataset using `tf.keras.datasets` or equivalent PyTorch utilities.
- Visualize a sample of the dataset using Matplotlib.
- Check class distribution and perform a brief analysis.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Normalize image pixel values (scale between 0 and 1).
- Convert labels to one-hot encoding (if necessary).
- Optionally, split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

### 3. Data Augmentation
- Apply data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, or zooming using `ImageDataGenerator` in Keras or `torchvision.transforms` in PyTorch to increase dataset diversity.

### 4. Build the CNN Model
- Design a CNN architecture. Start simple, such as:
  ```
  Input -> Conv -> ReLU -> MaxPooling -> Conv -> ReLU -> MaxPooling -> Flatten -> Dense -> Output
  ```
- Use dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
- Select an appropriate activation function (e.g., ReLU) and optimizer (e.g., Adam).

### 5. Compile and Train the Model
- Compile the model with a suitable loss function, such as `categorical_crossentropy` for multi-class classification.
- Train the model on the training dataset and validate it on the validation set.
- Use early stopping or learning rate reduction callbacks for efficient training.

### 6. Evaluate the Model
- Test the model on the test dataset and calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Plot confusion matrices and learning curves (loss and accuracy).

### 7. Save and Deploy the Model
- Save the trained model for future use.
- Optionally, deploy the model using AWS or other cloud platforms.

## Results
The model should achieve good accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score with minimum loss.
